Verse
=====

Tired of installing and configuring web application servers and databases?

Sick of the load that dynamic CMS and blog software put on your cloud VM?

Still want layout and templating that these tools provide?

Love text files?

Verse is the website software for you!  Harkening back to the early days
of the web, Verse revives the near-dead art of hand-crafted HTML and
static (read:fast) web sites.
